# Grocery-Stores-in-Charlotte
The map that I decided to create was of Grocery Stores in Mecklenburg County, with zoning from the city of Charlotte.
I had trouble getting the geojsons onto my map because I downloaded them as shapefile and was trying to use QGIS or geojson.io to convert them into geojsons, but using a shapefile meants they did not have coordinates that could be used. I downloaded the data as a kml file and used geojson.io to convert them into geojsons, where they appeared on my map. The data that I found was from the open data website of Charlotte, North Carolina. I thought it would be cool to see what areas has a lot of grocery stores, and what other areas had little grocery stores and see if that compared to the zoning of the city. I do not remember using QGIS to edit a shapefile and being able to add an extra attribute where we could use that for symbology, so I could not figure out how to do this. I assume I would have had to count the amount of grocery stores in each zone, and then used the legend to display this. Since I couldn't do this, I did not put a legend onto the map. I also could not edit the zoning because i did not have this extra attribute. More practice with the legend and multiple data sources/editing them, would help me accomplish the goal of this lab.
